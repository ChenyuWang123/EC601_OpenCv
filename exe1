## How does a program read the cvMat object, in particular, what is the order of the pixel structure?

There are 2 main methods to read cvMat object:

1. Using macro:CV_MAT_ELSEM(mat,type,row, colume) to read cvMat. 

It is easy to implement but costs amount of time. 
   
2. Using pointer: functions like: cvPtrD and cvGetD (cvPtr1D, cvPtr2D, cvPtr3D,cvPtrND) to build your own pointer.

It is our preferred choice.
